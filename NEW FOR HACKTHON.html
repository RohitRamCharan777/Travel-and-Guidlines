      <p>Dubai is full of contrasts. There's the glittering skyline of skyscrapers so tall they defy imagination. There is the modern collection of stores and eateries, offering every option a traveler could want. And then there are the luxurious hotels, ready to welcome even the most discerning traveler in style and excess. Then there's the desert with its rolling hills of sand stamped with the footprints of Arabian oryx and gazelles; the souks with their labyrinth of stalls, bins overflowing with a rainbow of spices; and the traditional abra boats ferrying riders across the Dubai Creek </p>

        <p>Kerala is the tropical South India of dreams: a small state spreading from coast to mountains, cliffy beaches to wildlife-filled jungles surrounded by a patchwork of tea fields, with an ancient culture that stands apart from elsewhere in India. Many travelers visit Kerala for its gold-sand beaches and network of palm-fringed backwaters. After checking off these highlights, there are many other things to do in Kerala: head to the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary or Periyar National Park in the hills, or catch a dramatic Kathakali dance or other traditional performance. It’s easy to see why Kerala is nicknamed “God’s own country.”</p>

        <p>The town was a major 7th century seaport during the reign of the Pallava dynasty and is now an interesting open-air gallery of the dynasty's architecture. It's also known as Mahabalipuram (town of Mahabali), after mythical King Mahabali who was vanquished by Lord Vishnu. However, the Tamil Nadu government has officially called it Mamallapuram (town of Mamalla) in honor of the renowned Pallava ruler Narasimha I, who had developed the town as a seaport and trading center. He had the title of Mamalla, meaning "great fighter".</p>
